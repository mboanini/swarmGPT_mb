## Background:
{task_des}
## Role setting:
- Your task is to complete this predefined function according to the description.

## These are the environment description:
These are the basic descriptions of the environment.
{env_des}

## These are the User original instructions:
{instruction}


## These are GLOBAL APIs:
```python
{robot_api}
```

## These are the functions you can call directly even if they are not implemented now:
```python
{other_functions}
```

## These are the constraints that need to be satisfied in the implementation of the function:
{constraints}



## Task
Complete the following function. The output TEXT format is as follows:
### Reasoning: (reason step by step about how to implement this function.)
### Code:
```python
import ...(if necessary)
{function_content}
    ...(function body,you need to complete it)
```
## Notes:
- The global API and existing functions can be called directly without the need for imports.
- Generate bug-free, directly invocable function code according to Google's coding standards.
- Adjustable parameters should be taken as input parameters with default values set for each parameter.
- You can only write functions according to the task's specified format, and cannot generate other helper functions. If necessary, define sub-functions within the specified function.
- Take a holistic approach and reuse **existing functions as much as possible**; this function is just a part of the entire control system.
- Avoid using global variables, and do not use variable names that conflict with global variables within the function.
- Preserve the function's docstring but modify its content if necessary, ensuring the function name remains unchanged.
- Do not use while loops in the function body.
- Do not raising errors or using assertions in the function body.
- Do not assume any part of the code,because the code will be executed directly without any modification and human intervention.
- If the function definition or docstring needs modification, ensure the function name stays the same.
- Import required modules before the function name, not within the function body.
- The robot allocation method should be optimal, avoiding conflicts between robots.
- Task allocation will only occur once at the start of the task. The tasks assigned to each robot should take environmental changes into account and avoid relying on any single changing object.
- The allocation method for robots should ensure that the total movement distance for each robot is minimized while completing all tasks, and that no task conflicts occur (i.e., each robot is assigned a distinct task, with no overlap between tasks).
- The task allocation can include various types such as positions, lists of positions, or specific angles, based on the requirements of the task.
- Strictly follow the specified format.

## Notes:
- The API and existing functions can be called directly without the need imports.
- You need to generate bug-free, directly invocable function code according to Google's coding standards.
- You can only complete the functions specified in Task according to the specified format; you cannot generate other Helper functions. If necessary, you can define functions within this function.
- You can only call these existing functions and global Api, and you cannot define complex logic on your own,just call the existing functions.
- Import the required modules before the function name, and do not import them in the function body.
- Use the existing high-level functions.
- Do not use while loops
- Do not raising errors or using assertions in the function body.
- Do not assume any part of the code,because the code will be executed directly without any modification and human intervention.
- The allocation method for robots should ensure that the total movement distance for each robot is minimized while completing all tasks, and that no task conflicts occur (i.e., each robot is assigned a distinct task, with no overlap between tasks).
- Task allocation will only occur once at the beginning of the task, so the tasks assigned to each robot should take environmental changes into account and avoid relying on any single changing object.
- The task allocation can include various types such as positions, lists of positions, or specific angles, based on the requirements of the task.
- You should populate the output format based on the code you've written, as this output format will impact the code development for the Robots.
- Ensure that this function can be executed to completion and is able to return the expected output.
- Strictly follow the specified format.
